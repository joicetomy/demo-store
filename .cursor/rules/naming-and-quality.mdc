# 🧩 Naming, Structure, and Quality Rules

This rule ensures **consistency, clarity, and maintainability** across the entire project.

Cursor must always:

- Follow the **naming and folder structure** defined in `/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`.  
- Verify that files are created in their proper locations.  
- Maintain code quality and prevent logic leakage between layers.

---

## 🧱 1 · File Naming Conventions

| Type | Convention | Example |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Component | PascalCase | `ProductCard.tsx` |
| Hook | camelCase (starts with `use`) | `useCheckout.ts` |
| Container | PascalCase + `Container` suffix | `CheckoutContainer.tsx` |
| Service | lowercase domain | `checkout.ts` |
| Adapter | PascalCase + `Adapter` suffix | `checkoutAdapter.ts` |
| GraphQL Query | `<feature>.query.ts` | `orders.query.ts` |
| GraphQL Fragment | `<feature>.fragment.ts` | `product.fragment.ts` |
| GraphQL Mutation | `<feature>.mutation.ts` | `checkout.mutation.ts` |
| Redux Slice | camelCase + `Slice.ts` | `cartSlice.ts` |

**Rules:**

- Hooks must always begin with `use`.  
- Components must be PascalCase and end with `.tsx`.  
- GraphQL operations must be suffixed with `.query.ts`, `.mutation.ts`, or `.fragment.ts`.  
- Adapters must end with `Adapter.ts`.  
- Avoid generic file names (e.g., `index.ts` for logic files).

## 🧭 2 · File Placement Rules

| Folder | What Belongs Here | Examples |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| `/src/app/` | Route segments + Containers | `home/page.tsx`, `HomeContainer.tsx` |
| `/src/components/` | Atomic UI only (no logic) | `atoms/Button.tsx`, `organisms/ProductList.tsx` |
| `/src/hooks/` | Reusable logic hooks | `useCart.ts`, `useProducts.ts` |
| `/src/services/` | Data fetching, GraphQL, adapters, and APIs | `checkout.ts`, `graphql/queries/orders.query.ts` |
| `/src/store/` | Redux or Zustand state | `cartSlice.ts`, `authSlice.ts` |
| `/src/utils/` | Helper utilities (no side effects) | `formatCurrency.ts`, `handleError.ts` |
| `/src/styles/` | Global and theme styles | `globals.css`, `theme.ts` |

**Rules:**

1. No business logic inside `/components/`.  
2. No API calls inside `/hooks/`.  
3. Only `/services/` may access GraphQL or REST clients.  
4. `/app/` containers should never directly call APIs — use hooks instead.  
5. Avoid circular imports between folders.  

---

## 🧩 3 · Code Quality Standards

- Use **TypeScript strict mode** in `tsconfig.json`.  
- Prefer **async/await** instead of `.then()` chains.  
- Handle all loading and error states gracefully in hooks and containers.  
- Keep functions small and single-purpose.  
- Use explicit return types for all exported functions.  
- Ensure GraphQL operations have clear variable typings.  
- Avoid deeply nested conditionals — use early returns instead.  

---

## 🧠 4 · Linting & Formatting Guidelines

- Follow **ESLint + Prettier** configuration.  
- Indentation: 2 spaces.  
- Line length: 100 characters max.  
- Imports:
  - External packages first.  
  - Then absolute imports (`@/hooks`, `@/components`, etc.).  
  - Relative imports last.  
- Always sort and group imports automatically.  
- Always end files with a newline.

---

## 🧩 5 · Cursor Behavior Rules

When Cursor generates or edits code:

1. **Check existing files first** before creating new ones.  
   - If a hook or service already exists, prefer reusing or extending it.  
2. **Respect boundaries:**
   - Don’t create logic inside components.  
   - Don’t put UI inside services or hooks.  
3. **Ask before replacing** or overwriting an existing file.  
4. **Maintain consistent comments:**
   - Each generated file should include a short header:
     ```ts
     // Role: [Hook | Container | Service | Adapter]
     // Purpose: [Brief description]
     ```
5. **Follow architecture context:**
   - Always re-read `/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` before suggesting new file paths.
6. **Ensure naming alignment:**
   - Filenames, exports, and folder names must match conventions above.

---

## 🧩 6 · General Architectural Enforcement

Cursor must ensure that:

- Every new feature adheres to the same folder structure used across existing ones.  
- Containers delegate all data handling to hooks.  
- Hooks delegate all API or Saleor operations to `/services/`.  
- `/services/` modules call adapters before returning processed data.  
- Components receive only clean, ready-to-render props.

> **Reference:** `/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` defines the official architecture and is always the source of truth for naming, placement, and layering.
